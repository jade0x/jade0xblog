Tomorrow I embark on the <span class="pink">75 Hard Challenge</span>

This is not my first attempt (to be honest I can't recall how many times I have attempted this), but hopefully it is my first win!

This challenge is something I have been drawn to for some time, I was introduced to it early in its creation and rise to fame, drawn to the idea of building grit and determination. I love to go all in on a project, but being consistent daily, and having a strict schedule is a huge challenge for how I operate. My default setting is pretty flexible.

I want to come out of this knowing that I can push past my own objections, stay the course on a long term goal without getting lost in the (daily) weeds, and a massive sense of accomplishment.

## The 75 Hard Challenge

Information on this challenge is all over the internet, so I will try to be brief.

All I ask, is if you are planning on trying this, PLEASE listen to the podcast episode and read the website. I see too many people 'complete' the challenge, only they followed a social media checklist and did not get the full rules before starting.

### 75 Hard Rules

1. **Follow a structured diet**
   Diet is your choice. No cheat meals. No Alcohol.
   *I have set myself a caloric and macro goal, but I will not be disclosing at this time. I also have some doctor directed goals. I will be tracking with [LoseIt!](https://www.loseit.com/%20) so I will have data.*
2. **Two 45 minute workouts**
   2 workouts, 45 minutes each, a minimum of 3 hours apart. One must be outside. Outside means under the sky in the elements, not opening your garage door.
   *I have a gym program for 4x days a week, and the C25K program to run. Other workouts will included walks and yoga. Again, tracking this with Garmin.*
3. **Drink a gallon of water**
   This one get criticism as the goal is clearly based on gymbros and is not practical or health for everyone.
   *I will be drinking 1 Gallon, and tracking.*
4. **Read 10 pages**
   Must be non-fiction, educational, improve an area of your life, and audiobooks are not allowed. I understand his logic, he does not want anyone multitasking by using an audiobook. I will not accept anyone making that argument that audio books "do not count as reading" f\*\*\* all the way off with that.
   *I will be using physical and eBook's for this, I will also be listening to audiobooks will I will not count to this rule, but I will add in my summary of books read.*
5. **Take a progress picture**
   *I don't think I will be sharing these, I do not think this one is very important because you cannot see anything daily, but whatever.
   I will do this first thing the morning before my first workout*

### My Starting Point

Currently I am inconsistent with my fitness goals and routine (working from home is pretty flexible), I have not made much progress on my current reads, regularly getting distracted with my phone instead of reading.
I have always been good with hydration, but I predict I will be drinking more water and less other beverages to make the water goal.

### What Success Looks Like

By Day 75 I want to have a steady daily routine that I fall into out of habit, a positive mindset where I embrace a challenge, and to run 5km without stopping.
I hope to have finished at least 3 books.

I'll be documenting this journey right here. Expect honest reflections, challenges, victories, and hopefully some inspiration for your own journey.
