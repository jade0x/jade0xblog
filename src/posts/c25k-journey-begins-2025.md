## Why I'm Starting C25K

<span class="yellow">This is not my first rodeo!</span>
I've completed C25K maybe 4 times before, which is why I am headed back to the program for my running goals this year.
I still haven't achieved my goal of <span class="pink">being a runner</span>. I have had seasons where I went running regularly, and then seasons where I was winded walking up the stairs. I haven't broken into a consistent phase where I moved on to 10k and beyond - which I have always wanted to do.

<span class="blue">Ultimate goal?</span> Crossing Marathon off the bucket list, but for now? Let's do 5k under 30min to start.

## My Starting Point

Couch to 5K... My current status is Couch Potato
No pace, no distance, nada!

*I may be in negative with age, weight, and bad knee!*

## My Game Plan

I will be following the OG [C25K Site](https://c25k.com/c25k_plan/)
But to make life easier I will be using the [C25K app](http://www.c25kfree.com/) while I run.

I will not be modifying anything, however if I 'fail' a run (eg, cannot complete a run sprint), I will finish out the run for the day, and repeat it until I can complete it. There is no point continuing if I cannot complete a day, it will only get harder and my body is clearly not ready.

Iirc, Week 4 sucks going up to 5min runs, but Week 5 is the absolute worst. If I have to repeat any week it's that one!

## What I Hope to Achieve

After completing the program, I plan to continue training, though I am undecided on how just yet.

I know I want to get a faster 5k, and I want to move on to 10k. Both require different training, so I will have to pick.

I will also be celebrating the conclusion of the program by participating in a local 5k race! *TBD I have some options but it depends how my training goes!*

## My Toolkit

In addition to the C25K program [OG program here](https://c25k.com/c25k_plan/) &  [App version here](http://www.c25kfree.com/) , I also track my fitness with my Garmin watch & Connect app.
This is the app I will be using to track my pace, HR etc.

Otherwise, just some regular old workout clothes, I have a collection of wireless headphones, spotify/podcasts/audio books, and my [awesome Noosa Tri's|250](https://www.lauriesshoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Asics-Womens-Noosa-Tri-14-Orange-PopBlazing-Coral.png)

## Accountability

To stay accountable I will be recapping my progress weekly.
Halfway through I will commit to a 5k event and register, to keep me going to the end.
