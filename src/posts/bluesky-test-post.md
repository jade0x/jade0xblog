A short time ago I came across [this post](https://bsky.app/profile/emilyliu.me/post/3kveqmh5v5v2o) by [Emily](https://bsky.app/profile/emilyliu.me) and bookmarked it for future use.

In my previous life as a book-blogger, it was *beyond* frustrating writing thoughtful book reviews, and gaining 0 traction. \
It didn't matter how many 1000 of followers I made on Instagram or TikTok, people just don't want to click through (and platforms do not love sending users outside), but were kind enough to comment and hype up the platform posts. \
\
Today, I tried it out!
