Hi! I'm Jade! üëãüèª

I'm a **self-taught web developer**, currently focusing on JavaScript and Python. I enjoy learning how to bring ideas to life through coding.

I am a runner, bookworm, table-top gamer & Aussie living abroad. I love spending time outdoors & with my friends, family & dog, Bu!
Before diving into tech, I worked in non-profit community services as a Case Manager, & volunteer for State Emergency Services. #SES

This blog is my "learning in public" journal‚Äîdocumenting progress & sharing thoughts. I'm interested in web development, open source projects, & making knowledge more accessible.
I have a 'side-quest' with social media: learning how we got here, algorithms, the rise & spread of misinformation online, & how our comprehension skills & attention spans are being affected.

If you'd like to work together on interesting projects or if you're open to mentoring, I'd love to connect!
