Hi! I'm Jade! 👋🏻
I'm building things with JavaScript and documenting my journey. Former case manager making a career change into tech.
When I'm not coding, you'll find me training for my next race or lost in a good book with my dog Bu curled up nearby.
Open to connecting with fellow developers working on similar projects

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/jade0x), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jade-garafola/) or [Bluesky](https://jade0x.bsky.social).
