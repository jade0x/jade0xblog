Hi! I'm Jade! 👋🏻

Former case manager exploring the tech world, I'm documenting my journey while sharing what I learn along the way. When I'm not at my computer, you'll find me racking up running miles, lost in a good book, or hanging with my husband and our dog Bu.

I'd love to collaborate on open source projects and connect with others in tech.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/jade0x), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jade-garafola/) or [Bluesky](https://jade0x.bsky.social).
