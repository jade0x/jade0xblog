Hi! I'm Jade! 👋🏻

Former case manager turned developer, I'm documenting my journey into tech and sharing some things I learn along the way. When I'm not coding you'll find me racking up running miles, lost in a good book, or hanging with my husband and our dog Bu.

I'd love to collaborate on open source projects and connect with other developers.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/jade0x), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jade-garafola/) or [Bluesky](https://jade0x.bsky.social).
