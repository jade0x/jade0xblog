Hi! I'm Jade! 👋🏻

I'm building things with JavaScript and documenting my journey. Former Case Manager making a career change into tech. <br>
When I'm not coding, you'll find me logging running km's, lost in a good book, or hanging on the patio with the Mr and our dog, Bu.

Open to collaborating on same-interest open source projects!

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/jade0x), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jade-garafola/) or [Bluesky](https://jade0x.bsky.social).
